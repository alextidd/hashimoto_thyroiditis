      DNA and Hyb samples are in the PTA thyroid (DNA) study, RNA samples are in
      the PTA thyroid (RNA) study. Please find manifests attached. Samples are 
      labelled according to their well location and are either labelled DNA, 
      Hyb, or RNA. One thing that is different in this experiment, compared to 
      the previous plate – I stuck to the fragmentation conditions in the 
      ResolveOME protocol in this experiment. So the hyb fragments are a little 
      larger. If this doesn’t cause any issues then this would make pipelining 
      easier as you can use a single library prep for both the DNA and the hyb 
      samples. The hyb plex is also bigger. Here I plexed 80 samples in a single 
      hyb pool, previously I did 48 samples. Hyb capture was performed with your
      immune panel.

      I tried to hyb capture ResolveOME samples to see if we can enrich for
      regions of interest. I hyb captured the Hashimoto samples (PD63118 – Plate
      1) and 29 PBMC samples from the automation test plate. I used the immune
      panel for target enrichment. The data is here:
      https://sfweb.internal.sanger.ac.uk:12443/perl/npg/run/49686 (lane 3).
      The samples are mixed with RNA samples, but you can identify the hyb
      samples as I have included this information in the sample name.

      Here is the plate layout and the manifests for the Hyb (50227 lane 7) and
      RNA (50227 lane 8).

      Here is an updated list of genes (sorry there is an overlap with the ones
      you have done but no need to re run them). These are selected genes 
      approaching gene-level significance (q < 0.1) and a few genes with bona
      fide GOF hotspots / regions but without significance (KRAS, BRAF for
      example).

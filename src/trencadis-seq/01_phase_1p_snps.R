# the longest 1p LOH event is observed in cells plate3_wellA2, affecing the 
# entire 1p arm, and is therefore expected to be homozygous all SNPs.
# we can therefore phase all SNPs in PD63118 chr1p.
# then, i will look for genic SNPs, as these will be most likely to be picked up
# in the snRNAseq in order to classify cells.
